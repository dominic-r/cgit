gitweb - A fast web interface for Git
=====================================

gitweb is a fork of cgit, a CGI-based web frontend for Git repositories.
It uses a built-in cache to decrease server I/O pressure and serves
pages through a CGI/FastCGI interface.

This fork adds several features on top of upstream cgit:

  * Compare view - side-by-side branch/tag comparison (like GitHub's
    compare page), with commit list, diffstat, and full diff
  * Code search improvements
  * Better navigation and UI refinements
  * Restructured source tree (src/core/, src/ui/, include/)
  * Syntax highlighting via Pygments

Building
--------

gitweb requires a matching version of Git to be built alongside it.

To download the required Git source and build:

    $ make get-git
    $ make

To install (defaults to /var/www/htdocs/cgit):

    $ sudo make install

To build without Lua support:

    $ make NO_LUA=1

To specify a Lua implementation:

    $ make LUA_PKGCONFIG=lua5.1


Dependencies
------------

  * libzip
  * libcrypto (OpenSSL)
  * libssl (OpenSSL)
  * optional: luajit or lua (pkg-config recommended)


Development
-----------

A local development setup using nginx + fcgiwrap is included:

    $ make get-git
    $ make
    $ ./dev/run.sh

This starts a local server at http://localhost. The dev configuration
files (dev/cgitrc, dev/nginx.conf) contain paths specific to the
maintainer's machine and will need to be adjusted for your setup.

A Docker-based setup is also available (runs nginx + fcgiwrap in a
container):

    $ cd dev && docker compose up


Configuration
-------------

Runtime configuration is read from /etc/cgitrc (or the path specified
via the CGIT_CONFIG environment variable). See cgitrc.5.txt for all
available options.
